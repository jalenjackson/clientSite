                    of life by establishing a setting where individuals with Intellectual Disability

                    has accomplished small steps in its large mission it continues to encounter many
                    challenges.  One of the challenges the organization faces is to continue the quality, that make

                    residential homes and necessary medical services for individuals with (ID) in a time period where state rates continue to decrease.
                    Pauline & Thomas Healthcare has been able to accomplish one of its initial quality goals and that is to reach the highest tier of quality service
                    provided. Pauline & Thomas received an exceptional performance on its most recent state mandated Quality
                    Assurance Survey. Pauline & Thomas Healthcare, Inc is proud to say the organization was only able to accomplish
                    this feat by the hard work of its dedicated employees, substantial support efforts from all service recipients support agents and
                    the continuous assistance from the Middle TN regional office of the Division of Intellectual Disabled Services.
